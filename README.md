Introduction
============

Gerrit is a code review system that emits events on every
change to a review.

We needed an easy way to push those events to a ticket system
or any kind of messaging system (like IRC or Jabber).

This library shall help implementing those gerrit-to-X connectors.

See the examples directory for an example on how to connect
gerrit to a Redmine system.

Have fun
